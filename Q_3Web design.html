            Web design refers to the process of designing and creating websites. It encompasses various aspects of website development, including the user experience, layout, and appearance. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content. Appearance relates to the colors, typography, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website<br>
            Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX) ². Responsive Web Design (a.k.a. "Responsive" or "Responsive Design") is an approach to designing web content that appears regardless of the resolution governed by the device. It’s typically accomplished with viewport breakpoints (resolution cut-offs for when content scales to that view). The viewports should adjust logically on tablets, phones, and desktops of any resolution. In responsive design, you can define rules for how the content flows and how the layout changes based on the size range of the screen ¹.
